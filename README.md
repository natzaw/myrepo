# Origins of Techno & House 
Ever since moving to Amsterdam 7 years ago, I’ve been in the midst of a techno love affair. The bass enveloped me, the beat hypnotized me and the high hat had me twirling till dawn. As much as my familiarity has expanded over the years, I haven’t really delved into its origins and explored its roots. This project has provided me the opportunity to do so.  In particular, I will explore sub-genres of Techno, House and Acid; gain insights about their similarities and differences at the genre and track level.  

The techno seed sprouted at about the same time in America and Europe in the late 80’s thanks to the wide availability of synthesizers and drum machines. Artist took their inspirations from early electronic musicians like Kraftwerk, Giorgio Mordor, and Depeche Mode. Chicago is known as the home of house music, getting its name from “bedroom style” production and evolving from the dying disco era, with funky groove, piano riffs and catchy chorus. The industrial landscape of Detroit inspired the rougher, faster and futuristic sound of techno. Across the pond, the rave scene in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and UK was exploding and expanding the variants of techno and acid, as well as house.  

To compile the project corpus, I searched for techno and house record labels that began in the late 80’s/early 90’s and searched for available tracks on Spotify. I created four playlists:  

Early Europe Techno 

Tresor Records: Berlin, 1991
